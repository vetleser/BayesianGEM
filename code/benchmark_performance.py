# The purpose of this script is to benchmark etcFBA model evaluation across the COBRApy and
# reframed implementations. Note that due to history constrains, this script cannot be used to benchmark
# both frameworks at the same time. Therefore, some git trickery is needed, consult benchmark_performance.sh
# for this challenge
